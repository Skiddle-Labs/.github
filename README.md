# Skiddle Labs

Hi 👋

**Skiddle Labs** is the experimental side of the Skiddle ecosystem.

This org exists for **learning by building** — a place to break things, prototype ideas, test infrastructure, and explore new tech without worrying about long‑term stability.

If Skiddle ID is the *release*, Skiddle Labs is the *workbench*.

## What You’ll Find Here

* Homelab experiments (clusters, networking, storage)
* Container orchestration & distributed systems tests
* Edge computing & Cloudflare experiments
* Scrapers, crawlers, and data pipelines
* AI / automation experiments
* Early APIs and rough proofs‑of‑concept

Many projects here are:

* Incomplete
* Poorly documented
* Subject to breaking changes
* Built for curiosity, not polish

Some of them may eventually graduate into **Skiddle ID**.

## Infrastructure & Learning Focus

Skiddle Labs is heavily influenced by hands‑on infrastructure work:

* Self‑hosted services
* Mini‑clusters & VM labs
* Docker, containers, orchestration
* Observability, monitoring, failure testing
* Exploring AI workloads in small‑scale environments

## Warnings

* No stability guarantees
* APIs may disappear
* Security is experimental
* Use at your own risk
